    <ul class="days">
      <li><b>Day 1:</b> Buying speakers that are too large or too deep <b>can make your new setup look goofy, and mess with your windows and door locks.</b></li>
      <li><b>Day 2:</b> Not calibrating the power source with your speakers, which will <b>lead to early wear and tear on your speakers causing early or imminent failure.</b></li>
      <li><b>Day 3:</b> Failing to properly secure the speakers will <b>diminish the value of your car by ruining its interior and have your speakers making rattling or bussing sounds.</b></li>
      <li><b>Day 4:</b> How incorrectly wiring the speakers is <b>one of the easiest ways to bust your amp.</b></li>
      <li><b>Day 5:</b> Not fastening all connections will damage your equipment through overheating, or, even worse… <b>set your car on fire!</b></li>
